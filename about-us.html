            Heyyyyy
            So this is my webpage about me.
            so do you want a debrief or what?well her we gooo
            
            Im just a girl who has so many ambitions and goals.
            Right now i feel very inferior coz for the first time im not among the smartest in the room. By now we all know that im am beginninng my journey in tech and obviouly there are those kids in my class who have an idea of what tech entails and then there is just me. Good thing  about me is that I dont give up easily. right now i have a lot to work for coz this is my future im preparing. i need good grades and to learn fast coz im in the point in life where i am the only one who can do something for my future. To be honest i feel very intimidated anytime i walk into class coz those kids are smart and geniuses and it means i dnt stand out yet. But that doesnt mean i cant be a s smart s they are. I have to learn to be consistent and very curious otherwise ill be so doomed.
            
            I aspire to grow every day  and learn something and by the end of it all i hope to have grown in my journey in tech.

            I love math and i hope that it doesnt give me stresss in campus as it did in highschool.There is so many things I would like to say but as at now that is where I sit academically

            I hope to graduate with a first class honours in Computer science in the year 2029 and become so successful at a very young age in my life.

            i hope this website looks okay and it it my very first webpage

             HOPE YOU ENJOYED.BYEEEEEE

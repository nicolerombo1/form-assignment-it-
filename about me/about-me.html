            This one was just hectic.
            It is basically on of the mountains of abadare ranges .
            It was so steep.
            There were so many false summits too.
            I saw a chameleon on this trail.(Amazing!)
            I  actually didnt finish the trail coz of the marshes but it was quite the adventure.
            I have to re-do this some time.

            Now this was a hike i can enjoyed from start to finish.
            like honestly...the weather was just perfect.
            the terrain was nice.
            Everything about is ws just Amazing.
            And then the summit had the beautiful crater lake(lake ellis) which was such a reward.
            there was also a waterfall along the way.
